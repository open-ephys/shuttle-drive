# Omnetics EIBs for Open Ephys Shuttledrive

**(Deprecated)** We do not recommend using these EIBs any longer, instead consider switching to the hirose based EIBs (https://open-ephys.org/drive-implant/64-channel-eib-lyfw2) together with the newer low-profile headstage https://open-ephys.org/acquisition-system/low-profile-spi-headstage-64ch. In the longer term, consider using the upcoming ONIX system with this drive.

For the 64 channel variant, extra care is required to keep a precise alignment between the two omnetics connectors.

The EIB for the ONIX system and the SPI compatible low profile hedstage are found in the ONIX system repository at https://github.com/jonnew/ONIX/tree/main/eib-64
